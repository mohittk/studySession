The database used is MongoDB. The reason behind using mongodb is ease of writing queries of mongodb in nodejs. We can easily build schema and query accordingly. I have created two schema, one for User and another for Sessions. Basically, user schema has user details such as name, email, password similarly, sessions has schema as title, subject etc. as given in document. 
The security consideration was an important aspect as we need to keep user data secure. All API's should be secure enough. I have used jwt authentication system to hash the passwords, and also to create auth_token. The way I have written the code is easy to understand, with all variable names with proper words that have meaning to respective property. 
Talking about maintainability and readability, it can be fairly seen in the code that it is easy to maintain and make some changes too. The code readibility is excellent. I didn't think much about scalability for now as this was just an assignment. 

My cheif task was to implement Backend. I have completed all the user stories given in the document. My UI part might not be good, you can test all my API's on postman. They are made at their best. I can explain my code very well.
